Colorsampler is an open source cross-platform (therefor it works on Windows, Linux, as well as Mac) alternative to the DigitalColor Meter found on virtually all Macs.  
Hover over a color on your screen and left click to get that color's hex code in your clipboard.

If you don't want to run the python code from source, you can utilize one of the single file executables below.


Requirements
------------
* Python 2.7 (Python 3 is untested)
* Pyside 1.2.1+
* pyperclip 1.3+


Usage
-----
* Left-click: sample the color you're hovering above.  
* Right-click: sample its complementary color.  
* Escape/Middle-mouse button: exit without sampling a color.
